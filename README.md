Name: Oliver Soto Lopez 
Project Description: My project is a program that runs a game similiar to stepping stones. Stepping stones is a game that allows the user to pick from left and right (typiccaly on a bridge with tiles, 
if wrong the tiles fall). There are two mode, easy being player_001 and player_456, these characters and the game idea were taken from squid games. In my functions file i hold all the four core functions.
The first one being choose difficulty that allows the user to choose between easy or hard and even lets the user choose to let the program pick for them with random functions. 
The second function holds the program for the easy mode allowing it to run smoothly. And the third function holds the program for the hard mode with aspects of using random. And the last function aks the user if 
they would like to play again.

Details on how you tested that your project worked. For example, what inputs did you try to test it. i watched youtube videos for debugging and how to use certain code and i just kept using recourses and 
trusting myelf.
as my program is quite simple.
What you learned overall: i learned how to be more aware of my recourse as i used past assignments to help guide me and overall make me a better coder.
The new Python feature or concept you explored. i learned how to incoperate 2 new random functions from the random libray such as random.choice and random.randint.
Challenges you faced and how you overcame them. The only challenged i faced was time, i procastinated only leaving little to no time left.
